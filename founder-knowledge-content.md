## FOUNDATION PRINCIPLES

### Core Truths About Founder Knowledge

**1. Knowledge Arbitrage is Your Edge**
- You don't need to know everything
- You need to know what matters NOW
- You need to learn 10x faster than competitors
- AI is your secret weapon

**2. The Learning Hierarchy**

**The $1000/hour Rule:**
- Your time is worth $1000/hour (or will be soon)
- Don't do anything someone else can do for <$200/hour

**Delegation Hierarchy:**

**Tier 1: Automate** (AI, Zapier, tools)
- No human needed
- Cost: $0-100/month
- Examples: Data entry, scheduling, email responses

**Tier 2: Offshore VA** ($5-15/hour)
- Simple, repetitive tasks
- Cost: $1000-2000/month
- Examples: Research, data cleanup, admin

- Examples: Design, writing, analysis

**Tier 4: Full-Time Employee** ($100K+ per year)
- Core company functions
- Long-term investment
- Examples: Engineering, sales, ops

**Delegation Process:**

**Step 1: Document the Task**
- Record yourself doing it (Loom)
- AI generates SOP from video
- Refine and test

**Step 2: Find the Person**
- Upwork, Fiverr, or referral
- Test with small project
- Scale if good

**Step 3: Handoff**
- Share SOP
- Do it together once
- Let them do it, you review
